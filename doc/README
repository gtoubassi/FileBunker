FileBunker is a file backup application which uses one or more GMail accounts
as a free, offsite backup repository.  While you may already dutifully backup
your data by burning CDs or writing tapes, in most cases those tapes end up
sitting on the shelf, mere feet away from the hard drive whose data is being
backed up. This data is vulnerable to a catastrophic event such as fire,
flood, or earthquake. By sending data offsite this problem is resolved. 

FileBunker requires Java (version 1.4.2_05 or higher) to run, so visit
http://java.sun.com to download the Java Runtime Environment.  If you already
have a suitable version of Java installed, FileBunker will find and use it.

On Windows, run FileBunker by double-clicking FileBunker.exe, which is
sitting next to this README file.

On Linux, run FileBunker by running the FileBunker shell script which is
sitting next to this README file. e.g.:
