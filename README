Welcome to the source release of FileBunker.  FileBunker is a file backup
application which uses one or more GMail accounts as a free, offsite backup
repository.

Compiling FileBunker
--------------------

The source code for FileBunker is located in the src directory.  In order
to build FileBunker you will need the libraries that FileBunker depends on.
The easiest way to get these libraries is to download the binary release
for your development platform, and copy the FileBunker/Resources/lib
directory from that release into your source directory (lib should be a peer
to src).  Note there is no make or ant file yet.

You will also need to make sure the compiler compliance is setup to allow
the assert keyword to be used.  For instance in eclipse, go to
Project->Properties->Java Compiler->Compliance and Classfiles and set the
source and classfile compliance level to 1.4.

Running FileBunker
------------------

The main class for the SWT GUI frontend to FileBunker is
com.toubassi.filebunker.ui.FileBunker.  The command line version is
com.toubassi.filebunker.commandline.FileBunker.

When running FileBunker make sure to pass the vm the argument
-Djava.library.path=lib/<platform> in order to be able to link against the
SWT native libraries.

Also make sure to pass a -config <directory> to specify the directory that
FileBunker will use to record configuration information.  Note that the
releases of FileBunker use the following directories:

	windows: c:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Local Settings\
				Application Data\FileBunker\default.bunker

	linux: ~/FileBunker/Default.bunker
